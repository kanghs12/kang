<h1>Lamborghini</h1>
<p>Company Anniversary in 1963.

<p>The Lamborghini design cue, which started from Countach, was greatly diluted when Lamborghini was sold to Audi, and then re-employed from Reventon and reached its peak in the 2011 Aventador. These days, they seem to have added fun to adopting a design that mimics a fighter. The main design points of the Reventon were designed after the F22 Raptor, which is still considered one of the best fighters in the world [9]. Because the design cue is very unique, accessories are also popular.</p>
<p>Although the number of units sold was smaller than that of Ferrari, it has now developed to an equal level. Since it started later than Ferrari, the number of historical models is relatively small. Currently, there are a total of 12 Ferrari production models. Lamborghini has three models: the flagship Aventador with a 12-cylinder engine, the entry-level model Huracan with a 10-cylinder engine, and the Urus.[10] Unlike Ferrari, the full model change cycle is long, but once in the middle, it undergoes a facelift and performance improvement, which Ferrari rarely does, so it does not lag behind much in performance.</p>
